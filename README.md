A mini framework to ease the development of your [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.com) apps.

Heavily inspired by [MarionetteJS](http://marionettejs.com/) from [Derick Bailey](http://lostechies.com).

#### Why?

This mini framework aims to be as lightweight as posible while providing the boilerplate code (and a bit more) for a Backbone.js app leaving out many other features that other frameworks add which I consider not that essential.

**Note:** This is in beta.

## Build process
There is a default [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com) file for the build process included in the `build/` folder to optimize the output of your Andamio.js app.

Just run `grunt` from the command-line inside the `build/` directory.
